There are several ways to clone a repository from GitHub:
Using the Command Line: This is the most common method. You can use the git clone command followed by the URL of the repository to clone it to your local machine12.
Using GitHub Desktop: This is a graphical user interface (GUI) method. You can clone and open the repository with GitHub Desktop3.
Using Git GUI: This is another GUI method. You can use a Git-supported software to clone the repository2.
Using Visual Studio: Visual Studio also provides an option to clone repositories2.
Using GitHub CLI: GitHub CLI is a command-line tool that brings pull requests, issues, and other GitHub concepts to the terminal next to where you are already working with git and your code1.
