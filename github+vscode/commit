what are the stages of commit ?

Files in a Git repository go through three stages before being under version control12:

Untracked: The file exists, but is not part of Gitâ€™s version control12.
Staged: The file has been added to Gitâ€™s version control but changes have not been committed12. This is where git add comes into play. You can add the changes you made to a file to staging using the command $ git add <path-to-file>3. If you want to add all the files at once, you can use $ git add .3.
Committed: The change has been committed12. This is where git commit comes into play. To commit use the command: $ git commit -m "some descriptive message"3. This moves files from the Staging Environment to the repository, with the message you provide4.
These stages are important as they give you fine-grained control over the versions of your files. You can easily change your mind when things are in staging, but once you have made a commit things are harder to change (although not impossible!)3.

In Git, the process of committing changes involves several stages:

1. **Working Directory**: This is where you'll be doing all the work: creating, editing, deleting and organizing files.

2. **Staging Area (or Index)**: Before a commit, changes are first recorded in a staging area. The `git add` command is used to add changes to the staging areaÂ¹. This is like preparing a draft of what you want to commit. You can add partial changes, single files, or multiple files to the staging areaÂ².

3. **Commit**: When you're ready, you use the `git commit` command to save your changes. This takes the files as they are in the staging area and stores that snapshot permanently to your Git directoryÂ¹. A commit is a snapshot of your repository at a specific time, and it includes metadata like the author, timestamp, and a message describing the changesÂ².

Remember, the staging area helps you craft your commits properly. Commits should be logical, atomic units of change that represent a specific ideaÂ². This means you can stage parts of changes, or changes in some files, and commit them separately from others.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any other questions. ðŸ˜Š
