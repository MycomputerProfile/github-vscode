what does the fork mean ? 

Forking in GitHub refers to creating a personal copy of an existing repository within GitHub. When you fork a repository, you essentially make a duplicate of it, enabling you to freely experiment with the codebase without affecting the original project. Here’s how it works:

Pull Requests:

If you’ve made improvements or fixes in your fork, you can submit a pull request to the original repository.
A pull request asks the project maintainers to review your changes and consider merging them into the original repository.
It’s a way to contribute back to the project while keeping your fork separate.
In a nutshell, forking allows you to experiment, contribute, and propose changes without directly altering the original project. It’s like making a copy of the question paper for students to work on, while the teacher retains the master copy for assessment! 📝🔗

Remember, forking is a powerful feature in collaborative software development, especially in open-source projects. It helps maintain the integrity of the main repository while encouraging community contributions. 🌟

what is watch in github ?

In GitHub, the concept of “watching” is related to staying informed about activity in a repository. Here’s what it means:

Watching a Repository:

When you watch a repository, you’re essentially subscribing to receive notifications about various events related to that repository.
These events include:
Pull Requests (PRs): When someone opens or updates a pull request.
Issues: When new issues are created or existing ones are modified.
Commits: When code changes are pushed to the repository.
Releases: When new versions of the software are published.
Other Repository Activity: Such as comments, wiki edits, and more.
Why Watch?:

Stay Updated: Watching a repository helps you stay informed about changes and discussions related to projects you’re interested in.
Collaboration: If you’re part of a team or community, watching a repository ensures you don’t miss important updates.
Customization: You can choose which types of notifications you want to receive (e.g., only PRs, only issues, or everything).
How to Watch:

To watch a repository, simply click the “Watch” button at the top right of the repository page.
You can also unwatch a repository anytime if you no longer want to receive notifications.
Difference Between Watching and Starring:

Watching is about notifications. It keeps you informed.
Starring, on the other hand, is like bookmarking a repository. It doesn’t provide notifications but helps you keep track of repositories you find interesting.
In summary, watching a repository in GitHub ensures you’re in the loop about all the exciting developments happening in that project! 🌟👀
